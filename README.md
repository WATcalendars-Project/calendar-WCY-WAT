# This repo is no longer supported.

Due to changes on scraped websites, such as loading content with JavaScript, the ability to use the Python `requests` library has been disabled.

I have moved the main project to a new repository called [WATcalendars](https://github.com/dominikx2002/WATcalendars), where you can check the latest code.

## If you were using these calendars on your phone, please unsubscribe from them and visit the new official supported website containing up-to-date calendars: https://watcalendars.byst.re
